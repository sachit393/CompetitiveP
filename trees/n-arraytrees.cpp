//Genral n array tree

//every node can have n children at most ={0,1,2,3,....n} children are possible

// binary tree is also a three array trees
// degree of tree is to be predecided
// n array tree is also n+1 array tree

// Strict n array tree
// height(h) vs nodes(n) for strict m array trees
// every node can have either 0 or n children

//given height min nodes n=m*h+1
// given height max nodes n=(m^(h+1)-1)/(m-1)

// IF n nodes are given min and max height
// given n nodes max height=(n-1)/m
// fiven n nodes min height=log(_m)[n*(m-1)+1]-1

// relationship between e,i
//e=(m-1)*i+1
